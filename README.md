This repository serves as a personal journal to track my progress.
It’s not about providing model answers or crafting perfect, polished codes.
Instead, it’s a space for me to observe my journey, document my mistakes, and reflect on the solutions I discover—no matter how imperfect they might seem.
It’s about embracing the learning process and understanding that the path itself is just as important as the destination.
And maybe, over time, this will also become a record of how I evolved—from rough, experimental beginnings to writing beautiful, functional, and clean code with confidence.
